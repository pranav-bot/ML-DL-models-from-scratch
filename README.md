# ML-models-from-scratch
<ul>
<li>This contains the most commonly used machine learning models written from scratch without the use if any libraries except Numpy which is used for calculations</li>
<li>Every model contains a test file on which the algorithim created is tested on various datasets</li>
<li>There are hand-written notes explaining every model in detail of how how it works and how mathematical equations fit into the picture</li>
